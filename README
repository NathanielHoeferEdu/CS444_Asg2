CS 444 - Assignment 2 Script

The contents of this folder is as follows:
 - compile_errors.sh
	This is the script for the assignment
 - script_test/
	This directory is to be used to test the script and its functionality. It contains 3 directories (Ts1, Ts2, Ts3) that represent an executed test, each with its own unique test.log file. 

The procedure of testing the script should be appearant from the documentation found within the script's file, but you can also follow the same steps to use the script_test directory. 

1. Error compilation for a single test:
	Execute script from this directory, passing in a path to one of the Ts* directories, or move to one of those directories and execute script without argument.

2. Error compilation for multiple tests:
	Execute script from this directory, passing in the path to the script_test directory or move to that directory. Be sure to use the -r flag.
